**Tesla Stock Forecasting Using LSTM**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Parvezkhan0/Tesla-Stock-Forecasting-Using-LTSM.git)  
This repository contains notebooks and datasets for a comprehensive project focused on forecasting Tesla (TSLA) stock prices. The predictive models employed include a single-step LSTM for immediate forecasting and a multi-stacked LSTM for extended predictions, spanning multiple days into the future (equivalent to a month in business days). The documentation not only presents the practical implementation but also provides an insightful exploration of the intuitive and mathematical underpinnings of LSTM networks.

**KryptoWalletApp**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Parvezkhan0/KryptoWalletApp.git)  
KryptoWalletApp is a basic Hardhat project showcasing Ethereum development practices. It features a sample contract, a corresponding test suite, a deployment script, and an example task implementation. This serves as a foundation for developers to explore and understand the functionalities of Hardhat in Ethereum development.

**Customer-Segmentation-for-E-commerce**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Parvezkhan0/Customer-Segmentation-for-E-commerce.git)  
This project involves segmenting customers to predict what they would buy on their next visit according to their history. It includes product clustering using tf-idf technique and customer clustering using K-Means Clustering algorithms, with a final classification using various models like SVM, Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Ada Boost.

**Social Media Sentiment Analysis**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Parvezkhan0/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Social-Media-Data.git)  
This project involves analyzing sentiments and manifestations (comments, hashtags, posts, tweets) of Twitter users based on the main trends (e.g., COVID-19) using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Classification with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

**Threads-Sentiment-Insights**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Parvezkhan0/Threads-Sentiment-Insights.git)  
This project investigates the intricate factors shaping user ratings and conducts sentiment analysis on reviews from app stores and Google Play for Threadfluence, an Instagram-backed app. The analysis aims to decode the elements driving user ratings and unravel the sentiments expressed in the reviews.
